# Dataset
The Microsoft Research Kaggle Cat vs. Dog Dataset serves as an excellent demo. Simply download the dataset and remove 128 examples from the holdout list.

# Dependencies

Tensorflow > 1.2 (GPU strongly recomended)
This repo uses the Tensorpack library and this particular has been updated to work with Tensorpack 0.8.9.
See the other branch to see the original version that worked only with Tensorflow version <=1.3.
